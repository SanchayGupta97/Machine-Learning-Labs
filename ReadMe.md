This Repository contains Machine learning model that were done on a Bike sharing Dataset available at UCL Dataset repository.
Bike sharing Dataset is a  regression dataset but, in the lab I have also applied different classification model in order to judge the accuracy of classification and regression model on a dataset that is mainly regression
